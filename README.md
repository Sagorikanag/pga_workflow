# Pangenome Guided Genome Assembly Workflow


## Directory Structure
* `workflow/`: Contains the main Snakefile (Other snakefiles are inside `other_snakefiles/`)
* `config/`: Contains snakemake configuration files for different datasets
* `benchmark/`: Runtime and resource usage statistics for individual Snakemake rules
* `logs/`: Standard output and error logs for each rule execution, useful for debugging
* `results*/`: Output files generated by the pipeline.


## Run the workflow
From the pga_workflow/ directory, run:
```sh
snakemake --use-singularity --singularity-args "-B /private/groups/" --configfile config/config_ontR10.yaml --cores 128
```
To resume the workflow from where it left off (e.g., after interruption), use:
```sh
snakemake --use-singularity --singularity-args "-B /private/groups/" --configfile config/config_ontR10.yaml --cores 128 --rerun-incomplete
```
This will rerun any jobs that were incomplete or failed during the previous run.
